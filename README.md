# CatBallAndroid
A simple ball game as my first Android game rehearsal.

In the game you're a playful cat in a room with balls. Since there are so many balls you only cares about the most shiny balls, and too much contact with dull single matt color balls will overwhelm you with boredom. Therefore the game idea is to catch only flashing balls and avoid all other balls to have the most fun!

Game is controlled by touch control (or mouse): the location you press is the direction the cat will aim to go. The further away the target location is, the faster cat runs - and then you're easily both sliding further than intended and jumping across the walls, so take care where you poke! Points gather up by collecting flashy balls and by time. The smaller the gathered balls are, the more points are gained. The longer you have survived (the more balls have spawned), the more points you will get by time. Being hit by single coloured balls will reduce your interest energy, which is indicated by a green bar on the side of the screen.

Current version (beta package / pre-gamma development code) has no start again option at all, so in order to start a new game you'll need to reload the app, or flip the screen and the game should automatically reload with different orientation if your Android device has this feature on.
